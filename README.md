The main intent of making this project was to understand how a library like Redux simplifies the process of state management. Though it was a basic project, some inferences that I made from the process were that it,

-   Contains a lot of boilerplate code even for small tasks like updating a single variable.

-   Simplifies the codebase by seperating component logic and state management logic.
-   Is easily maintainable since it follows a strict code structure.
-   Is easily debuggable because of Redux DevTools.
-   Is better in performance since components only re-render when the respective state is changed (which is not the case in Context API)
